see `lib/tiny_color.rb` for usage.

this is a tiny gem, typically a single `class` or `module` meant to add a very
simple and focused capability. because the gem is meant to be tiny forever it
is considered feature complete. unless there are bugs, typos, or very basic
features to be added I don't plan to accept PRs.

please enjoy.
