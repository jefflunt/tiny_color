see `lib/tiny_color.rb` for usage.

this gem is part of a number of `tiny_*` gems, which are typically a single
`class` or `module` meant to add a very simple and focused capability. because
the gem is meant to be tiny forever it is considered feature-complete. unless
there are bugs, typos, or very basic features to be added I don't plan to accept
PRs.
